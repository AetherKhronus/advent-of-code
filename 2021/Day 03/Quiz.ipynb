    "The submarine has been making some <ins>odd creaking noises</ins>, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.\n",

    "The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the __power consumption__.\n",

    "You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the __gamma rate__ and the __epsilon rate__). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n",

    "Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the __most common bit in the corresponding position__ of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n",

    "- Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer `1` bits (2) than `0` bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a `1` in the second position: `01111` and `01010`.\n",
