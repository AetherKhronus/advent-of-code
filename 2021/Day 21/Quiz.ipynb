    "There's not much to do as you slowly descend to the bottom of the ocean. The submarine computer <ins>challenges you to a nice game</ins> of __Dirac Dice__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game consists of a single die https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice , two pawns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_board_games#piece , and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked `1` through `10` clockwise. Each player's __starting space__ is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players take turns moving. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die __three times__ and adds up the results. Then, the player moves their pawn that many times __forward__ around the track (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to `1` after `10`). So, if a player is on space `7` and they roll `2`, `2`, and `1`, they would move forward 5 times, to spaces `8`, `9`, `10`, `1`, and finally stopping on `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each player moves, they increase their __score__ by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at `0`. So, if the first player starts on space `7` and rolls a total of `5`, they would stop on space `2` and add `2` to their score (for a total score of 2). The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches __at least `1000`__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled __deterministic dice__ and a 100-sided die falls out. This die always rolls `1` first, then `2`, then `3`, and so on up to `100`, after which it starts over at `1` again. Play using this die.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given these starting positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Player 1 starting position: 4\n",
    "Player 2 starting position: 8`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the game would go:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `1`+`2`+`3` and moves to space `10` for a total score of `10`.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `4`+`5`+`6` and moves to space `3` for a total score of `3`.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `7`+`8`+`9` and moves to space `4` for a total score of `14`.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `10`+`11`+`12` and moves to space `6` for a total score of `9`.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `13`+`14`+`15` and moves to space `6` for a total score of `20`.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `16`+`17`+`18` and moves to space `7` for a total score of `16`.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `19`+`20`+`21` and moves to space `6` for a total score of `26`.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `22`+`23`+`24` and moves to space `6` for a total score of `22`.\n",
    "\n",
    "...after many turns...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `82`+`83`+`84` and moves to space `6` for a total score of `742`.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `85`+`86`+`87` and moves to space `4` for a total score of `990`.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls `88`+`89`+`90` and moves to space `3` for a total score of `745`.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls `91`+`92`+`93` and moves to space `10` for a final score, `1000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since player 1 has at least `1000` points, player 1 wins and the game ends. At this point, the losing player had `745` points and the die had been rolled a total of `993` times; `745 * 993 = `__`739785`__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play a practice game using the deterministic 100-sided die. The moment either player wins, __what do you get if you multiply the score of the losing player by the number of times the die was rolled during the game?__"
