    "It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special characters in strings. For example, C https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C, JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String, Perl https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators, Python https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html, and even PHP https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.double handle special characters in very similar ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to realize the difference between the number of characters __in the code representation of the string literal__ and the number of characters __in the in-memory string itself__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"\"` is 2 characters of code (the two double quotes), but the string contains `0` characters.\n",
    "- `\"abc\"` is `5` characters of code, but `3` characters in the string data.\n",
    "- `\"aaa\\\"aaa\"` is `10` characters of code, but the string itself contains six \"a\" characters and a single, escaped quote character, for a total of `7` characters in the string data.\n",
    "- `\"\\x27\"` is `6` characters of code, but the string itself contains just one - an apostrophe (`'`), escaped using hexadecimal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa's list is a file that contains many double-quoted string literals, one on each line. The only escape sequences used are `\\\\` (which represents a single backslash), `\\\"` (which represents a lone double-quote character), and `\\x` plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the four strings above, the total number of characters of string code (`2 + 5 + 10 + 6 = 23`) minus the total number of characters in memory for string values (`0 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 11`) is `23 - 11 = 12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disregarding the whitespace in the file, what is __the number of characters of code for string literals__ minus __the number of characters in memory for the values of the strings__ in total for the entire file?"
